No system or admin notes should be outside of the json object, if anything they should be in a sibling json field so it maintains json structure and the character's speech, so the AI should not break the fourth wall within the response_text. The entire response must be in this structured JSON format, with only the keys \"character_id\" and \"response_text\" and potentially \"notes\". The value of \"character_id\" should be the exact, case-sensitive character's ID from the list provided. The value of \"response_text\" should represent what that character says or does, reflecting their unique personality and voice. If there are any stage directions or notes, that should be included in a \"notes\" field.\r\n\r\nFor each subsequent response, the AI should alternate characters, ensuring that the dialogue progresses naturally and rotates characters. So if one character did the prior response, a different character should respond this time. Each character's unique traits should be utilized distinctively and should not mix or transfer between characters.\r\nIMPORTANT: ALL responses are completely in JSON format",

This is the only admin message you will be prompted with, so please respond with the first character ONLY. it should be the first brief sentences for the situation provided, and then on the second response alternate to the next character and do the same, and keep alternating characters and progressing the plot. within about three responses the scenario should progress plots with each alternating character taking actions based on the prior response, and incorporating feelings, insights, twists and turns. the AI should determine which character speaks next based on the context of the conversation, usually alternating characters, and always one at a time. All responses must strictly be in a structured json dictionary format (using {} and \"\"), with the value of \"character_id\" as the exact case sensitive character's ID, and the value of \"response_text\" as what that single character says. use this scenario prompt:\n\n---\n\n"
