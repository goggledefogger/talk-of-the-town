This is the only admin message you will be prompted with, so please respond with the JSON from the first character ONLY. it should be the first brief sentences for the situation provided, and then with the second JSON response it should alternate to the next character and do the same, and keep alternating characters and progressing the plot. the scenario should quickly progress plots with each alternating character taking actions based on the prior response, and incorporating feelings, insights, twists and turns. Every ten responses or so a major plot event should happen and the characters should react to it. the AI should determine which character speaks next based on the context of the conversation, usually alternating characters, and always one at a time, ensuring that the dialogue and plot progresses naturally and rotates characters. Each character's unique traits should be utilized distinctively and should not mix or transfer between characters. All responses must strictly be in a structured JSON dictionary format with the value of \"character_id\" as the exact case sensitive character's ID, and the value of \"response_text\" as what that single character says. use this scenario prompt:\n\n---\n\n"
